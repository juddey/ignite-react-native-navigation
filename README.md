# ignite-react-native-navigation

The awesomess of [ignite](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite) with the awesomeness of [react-native-navigation v2](https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation), all packaged up for your [react native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) project.

## Warnings.
 - RNN's maintainers are waiting for 58.0 to drop so they can fix a few issues, so you might want to hang out for that if you're risk averse.
 - This readme follows the master branch of this repo.
 - Like `yarn eject` from `create-react-app`, this operation is one-way; but once you have this navigator, you won't want to go anywhere else.
 - This plugin supports React Native `0.57.4` or greater. 

```js
ignite add ignite-react-native-navigation
```

Enjoy!

### Credits
Shoutouts to: [Odesea](https://github.com/Osedea/ignite-native-navigation) who wrote a plugin for RNN v1, and on whose efforts much of this logic is based. Who knows, we might even combine them in the future. I'm interested.
